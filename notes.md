## Q. Why server.js

- we will be usign socket io, so we need to create a server

`morgan` - used to log requests

services - we put those things which are outside the server or node js. like mongo db

using react router loader:

in the component where we want to use the loader. next connect to the route by adding

1. create a loader function
2. loader: menuLoader
3. use: const menu = useLoaderData();
